# Domains & Two-Layer Memory

Each domain has:
- **L0** (immutable reference): formal rules, axioms, canonical data.
- **L1** (experiential overlay): observations, enrichments, personal preferences, experiments.

Examples:
- **Language**: L0 dictionary/rules, L1 enriched senses, usage stats, preferred phrasings.
- **Math**: L0 definitions/axioms/theorems, L1 experiments/conjectures/notes.
- **Vision**: L0 label schemas/ontologies, L1 observations/detections quirks.
- **System**: L0 schemas for events, L1 episodes of system behavior.
